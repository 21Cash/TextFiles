In competitive programming problems, sometimes they want answer in the form of (ans)%(10^9+7), this means that the actual answer to a problem lies above the range of 64-bit integer which is not possible to calculate so they want only the remainder left behind your actual answer.

Therefore to tackle with this problem, you just simply learn two basic rules:

1.) (a+b)%m = (a%m+b%m)%m.

2.) (a*b)%m = (a%m*b%m)%m.

so next time when you comes to this situation just apply the rules given above at each step of your calculation.

for ex: to calculate the factorial of a large number N (1<=N<=10^9) modulus (10^9+7)

so the solution is :

fac=1, mod = 10^9+7

for(i=2;i<=N;++i)

fac = (fac%mod*i%mod)%mod
